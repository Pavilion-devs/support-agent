Perfect ✅ — I see this layout now. It’s structured like a **modern B2B SaaS landing page** (dark mode, boxed sections, clear pricing, testimonials). We can replicate this exact structure for **Twisky** but swap in **AI support platform content**.

Here’s the **adapted Twisky landing page content (section by section):**

---

## **Hero Section**

**Headline:**
*"Customer support, reinvented for B2B"*

**Subheadline:**
*Resolve customer issues faster with AI agents. Automate support across Slack, WhatsApp, and Email — all in one platform.*

**CTA buttons:**
👉 \[Get Early Access]
👉 \[Book Demo]

**Mini text:**
*Trusted by fast-growing teams to scale customer success with less effort.*

---

## **Product Preview (like "Transactions" box)**

Instead of financial transactions, we show support activity.
**Tabs:**

* Conversations
* Knowledge Base
* Escalations

**Cards example:**

* **Conversation:** *“Customer asked: How do I set up SOC 2 compliance?” → Resolved by AI in 12s.*
* **Escalation:** *“Customer asked about advanced vulnerability scanning → Escalated to Slack.”*
* **Knowledge:** *“Updated docs: Pricing & Billing FAQs.”*

---

## **Everything Your Business Needs (Feature Grid)**

**AI-Powered Support**

**Smart Escalations**

👉 Question: Do you want me to **turn this into a ready-to-use Next.js + Tailwind landing page template (dark mode, like the screenshot)** so you can deploy on Vercel immediately, or should I just finalize the **copywriting text** so you paste into Webflow/Framer?
